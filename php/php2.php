Hello world!

With '' symbols:
<?php
$first_name = 'Laurent';
echo 'My first name is ' . $first_name . '.';
$last_name = 'Garnier';
echo 'My last name is ' . $last_name . '.';

echo "\n\nWith \"\" symbols:\n";
echo "My first name is $first_name \n";
echo "My last name is $last_name \n";

$mark1 = 12;
echo "The 1st mark is $mark1 \n";

$mark2 = 14;
echo "The 2d mark is $mark2 \n";

$mean = ($mark1 + $mark2) / 2;
echo "So, the mean is $mean.";
?>

Howdy?
